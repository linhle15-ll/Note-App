2 stores:
Note stores: add/delete/update/get note(s)
The same for folder stores:

Note: On delete a file/ folder, need to popup confirm modal
(delete a modal means delete all the files within that modal so it is very dangerous)

- Select: categorize note to their folders
  + In folder store: when add new folder, add the folder to the folderArr
  + map the elements in the folder arr to the select in create new note showModal
  + other folder -> onClick -> popup add new folder modal to add new modal -> then add the file to that folder

When they are all fine, we can add other features like allows add image(like text field) in to the note
